# renee-uj-portfolio

## Description

The aim of this projet was to create a responsive portfolio to host my project work as a budding front ed we developer. To create the page, I was given starter HTML and CSS code as wel as some images to use on the page. The methods learnt prior to creating the portfolio inluded CSS flexbox and CCS grid, both were integral in forming the layout of the page and getting the elements into the desired place. 

To build on the starter code, I used previous activites and contes of my own to help inform the additions to the code to further put inot practice all that I have learnt. 

This project highlishts the importance CSS styling and the use of the correct tags in the HTML code in order to target the relevant elements to get the dersired out come of the page.
